# Contributing to DIRACGrid

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting started

The [DiracX contributing guide](https://diracx.io/dev/how-to/contribute/) covers the full development workflow, including setting up your environment, making changes, and submitting pull requests. The [getting started tutorial](https://diracx.io/dev/tutorials/getting-started/) walks through setting up a local development environment.

If you're looking for something to work on, check out issues labelled ["good first issue"](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ADIRACGrid+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues).

## Quick reference

- **Commits**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **Branches**: Name your branch descriptively, e.g. `feat/add-widget` or `fix/login-error`
- **PRs**: Reference the related issue in your PR description (`Closes #123`)

## What to expect from reviews

PRs are reviewed by project maintainers. Here's how the process works:

1. Open your PR and mark it as **Ready for review** when it's complete.
2. A reviewer will be assigned and will review your changes.
3. If a reviewer requests changes, the PR is **automatically converted to a draft**. This signals that it's back in your hands.
4. Address the feedback, push your updates, and mark the PR as **Ready for review** again.
5. A **daily digest** of open PRs is posted to ensure nothing gets forgotten.
